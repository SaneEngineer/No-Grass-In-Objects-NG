## No Grass in Objects NG

This is a port of No Grass in Objects rewritten using Commonlib, The main features of Caching, Raycasting (No grass in objects part), and extended grass distance are working in AE. The config is roughly the same with a change to toml, minor renaming of settings and an option for debug logs. To my knowledge all features except for grass scale should be working in SE, the same goes for AE.

## Installation Instructions:

1. Download and install the Mod Organizer 2 plugin from the original mod into your MO2 plugins directory, located here: [`Grass Generation MO2 Plugin v1 (fix)`](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42161?tab=files).
 - You will need to edit lines 56 and 57 to reflect `grassPluginPath = "SKSE/Plugins/"` and `grassPlugin = "*NGIO-NG.dll"`, as shown below.

2. You will then need to install the latest version of NGIO-NG located in the releases section [here on Github](https://github.com/SaneEngineer/No-Grass-In-Objects-NG/releases/). This needs to be installed to the `\Data\SKSE\Plugins\...` directory of your Skyrim installation.
3. You will now clock on the `Tools -> Plugins -> Precache Grass` option in your MO2 toolbar, which will launch (and re-launch) Skyrim to generate grass cache in your `Overwrites` folder per the settings in `GrassControl.ini`.
4. After you have waited, you should get a pop up message that says, `Grass Caching complete`, at which point you can copy the `\Grass\` folder from `Overwrites` into a new mod in MO2.
